# Purpose
These are experiments and projects being done, for joy's sake, in Pico 8. They
aren't really planned, and may not be finished - and that's OK.

## On Code Quality
These are experiments. Some of the code quality is not what I would prefer.
Further, the PICO-8 platform means that sometimes, I have picked an inefficient
algorithm that can fit inside a smaller amount of code tokens - particularly
when it's only running over 16 or so items. I'm avoiding premature
optimization - as, particularly in this case, it may limit the amount of
content I can fit.

# Carts
These carts may be loaded into the PICO8 interpreter.
